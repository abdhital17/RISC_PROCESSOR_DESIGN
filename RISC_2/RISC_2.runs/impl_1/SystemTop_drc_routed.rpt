PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A4))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
