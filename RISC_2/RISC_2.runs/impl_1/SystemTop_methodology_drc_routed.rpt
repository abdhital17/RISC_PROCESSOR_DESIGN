ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 360 control sets (vs. available limit of 4400, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-from : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ *ila_core_inst/u_trig/N_DDR_TC.N_DDR_TC_INST[*].U_TC/allx_typeA_match_detection.ltlib_v1_0_2_allx_typeA_inst/DUT/u_srl_drive/CLK}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '48' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
